## Who this is for

Primarily, these scripts are intended to be used by [Codeup](http://codeup.com)
students going through the Java program. However, you might find this repo
useful if you have a Java web application you want to deploy quickly with
tomcat, or if you want to host several Java projects on the same server.

This project is probably **not** for you if:

- You need to deploy anything that is not a `war`
- You want to use a database that is not MySQL
- You want to use a webserver other than tomcat

## Prerequisites

1. A java web application packaged as a war that can be served by Tomcat.
1. A server with a fresh ubuntu 16.04 install
1. Your ssh key on that server with access to the root account
1. For any domain (or subdomain) you want to host on your server, you will need
   to have the DNS records already configured to point to your server's IP.

## Quick Start

See also the [step by step deployment guide here.](deployment_guide.md)

Deploy a blog application and create a database for it:

```bash
# 1. clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/zgulde/tomcat-setup.git ~/my-awesome-server
cd ~/my-awesome-server

# 2. provision the server
./server

# 3. create a database and user for the application
./server db create blog_db blog_user
# optionally run a migration or seeder
./server db run blog_db ~/IdeaProjects/myblog/migration.sql

# 4. setup your server to listen for requests for your domain
./server site create myblog.com

# 5. deploy the war
./server site deploy myblog.com ~/IdeaProjects/myblog/target/myblog-v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
```

## Usage

The setup script is intended to setup and secure a server with a fresh install
of Ubuntu 16.04 and only a root account. When the server is first setup, a
`.env` file will be created that contains the name of the account you created
and the server's ip address. All of the other commands for managing the server
will check for this `.env` file to make sure the server is setup before trying
to do anything.

Broadly speaking, most of the commands will ssh into the server and run a command
or a series of commands to achieve the goal of the command. This allows us to
control the server from a local machine, without much need to log in to the
server itself.

Clone this repo once per server you wish to automate. For example, you might
have the following directory structure

```
~/
`---servers/
    `---personal-server/
    `---my-awesome-sideproject/
    `---capstone-project/
```

Once you have cloned this repo, you will need to setup and provision the server.
Have the ip address of your server handy, and then run the `server` script. The
script will detect that we don't have anything setup and run the first time
setup process.

This setup will allow you to host multiple different domains on each server. For
each site you wish to host, you will need to:

1. Setup the DNS Records for that domain to point to your server
1. Create the site
1. (Probably) Create a database and user for the application
1. Deploy a `war` that contains the application

### DNS Records + Site Creation

```bash
./server site create example.com
```

This command will setup virtual hosts with both tomcat and nginx for the domain
name you have provided.

When creating a new site, the `site create` subcommand will check to see if the
DNS records for the given domain point to your server. You will be given a
warning if they do not, but you can go ahead and create the site anyway if you
are still configuring DNS, or waiting for the records to propogate. To test your
site under these conditions, you can add a record in your `/etc/hosts` file that
looks like the following:

```
123.123.123.123 test.com
```

Where `123.123.123.123` is the ip address of your server, and `test.com` is the
domain name you wish to host. *Note that this will work on your computer, but no
one else will be able to visit the site until the DNS records are properly
configured.*

### Create Database + User

While theoretically you might not need to do this, most applications will need
to talk to a database in some form or fashion.

```bash
./server db create some_db some_user
```

This command will create a database and a user that has all permissions on that
database (but not any others).

You will be prompted for a password for the new database user.

#### (Optionally) Run a migration or seeder

Once your database is created, you can use the `db` subcommand to run a
migration or seeder script if you so desire.

You will need to provide the name of the database you wish to run the file on,
and the path to the `sql` file.

```bash
./server db run some_db /path/to/the/migration.sql
```

### Deploy The `war`

This will `scp` the file to the appropriate location on your server. Once you
run this command, you should be able to see your site live!

```bash
./server site deploy example.com /path/to/the/war/file.war
```

Of course, before you run this you will need to have packaged your application
as a war. For example, if you are using maven:

```bash
# from the root directory
mvn package
```

or with maven wrapper

```bash
./mvnw package
```

Alternatively, you can setup automated deployments with git.

## Git Deployment

When a site is setup, the server will also be setup for automated builds and
deployments with git. This is accomplished through a `post-receive` git hook.
This functionality is two-fold: there is a simple setup, and the ability to do
somethings more advanced (see the customizing deployment section below).

When the site is created, an empty git repository will be initialized and named
after the site, for example:

    /srv/example.com/repo.git

You'll see instructions for adding this as a remote to an existing project in
the output of the command that sets up the site.

When the repo is pushed to, the post-receive git hook will be triggered, which
will run the build for your project, or run a custom script.

To tell the hook how to build your project, you will need to (at a bare
minimum), add a file to your project defining how to build your project, and
where the built `war` file lives. To do this, create a file named
`.build_config` in the root of your project with the following contents:

`.build_config`

```bash
BUILD_COMMAND=command_to_execute_to_build_your_project.sh
WAR_FILE=relative_path_to_the_artifact.war
```

In addition, often times you will need to include a file in the build that is
not part of the git repository (e.g. a file with database credentials). To do
that, we can create that file on the server, and tell the git hook how to find
this file. To do this, create the file you want to be included in the build
inside of the directory named after your site inside of `/srv`, and edit the
`config` file found in the same place.

For example, if you needed an `application.properties` file included in the
build for `example.com`, but this file is ignored by git, you would do the
following:

1. ssh into the server and create the production `application.properties` file
   inside the `/srv/example.com/` directory.
1. edit the `/srv/example.com/config` file and define the name of the file to
   be included, as well as where in the project it should be copied to

Take a look at the `config` file or template for more information.

### Customizing Deployment

If your deploment needs are more complex than what is described above, you can
create a file named `install.sh` in the root of your project. This file will be
executed if a `.build_config` file is not found. This script will be executed
from your project root, and several environment variables are available to it:

- `SITE_DIR`: the directory that has the repo for your site, along with any
  config files you have setup there (example value: `/srv/example.com`)
- `WAR_TARGET_LOCATION`: Where the built war needs to end up so that tomcat can
  find it (example value: `/opt/tomcat/example.com/ROOT.war`)

Example `install.sh`

```bash
# exit the script on any errors
set -e

# 1. copy over any env specific files you setup on the server
cp $SITE_DIR/application.properties src/main/resources/application.properties
cp $SITE_DIR/secret.file src/main/resources/secret.file
cp $SITE_DIR/env.js src/main/javascript/env.js

# 2. Do any pre-build steps you need to (e.g. compiling css/js assets)
#    Any custom build/deployment logic should go here
echo '[install.sh] Installing dependencies...'
echo '[install.sh] > npm install'
npm install
echo '[install.sh] Building JS...'
echo '[install.sh] > npm run build'
npm run build

# 3. Build the war file and put it in the right place
echo '[install.sh] Building war file...'
echo '[install.sh] > ./mvnw package'
./mvnw package
mv target/my-awesome-project.war $WAR_TARGET_LOCATION
```

### Manually Triggering A Build

You can also manually trigger a build and deploy without needing to push to the
git remote on your server.

```
./server site build example.com
```

This will run the same script that runs when you push to the remote.

## HTTPS

The site management command has a sub command that will obtain a certificate
from [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and enable https on a per-site
basis.

To obtain a certificate from letsencrypt, you will need to have the DNS records
for your domain properly configured to point to your server, so that you can
prove ownership of that domain.

**Before using this command make sure you agree to the [Lets Encrypt Subscriber
Agreement](https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.1.1-August-1-2016.pdf).**

Simply run

```bash
./server site enablessl myawesomesite.com
```

After enabling https for a site, you can enable the automatic renewal of certificates:

```bash
./server autorenew
```

Note that while you do need to enable https for each site individually, you only
need to set up automatic certificate renewal once.

## Commands

The entrypoint for all commands is the `server` script. It contains various
subcommands for performing different activities on the server. The first time
this script is run it will perform the initial server setup and
provisioning. Once the server is setup you will be able to run the various
subcommands.

Any commands that require arguments can either be passed on the command line, or
the command can be run without arguments and you will be prompted for them.

To see all the available subcommands, run the `server` command without any
arguments.

In general, any password prompts will be for your server admin password (i.e.
your sudo password), unless you are running the `db` subcommand, in which case
you will need to enter the database administrator password.

### General Server Commands

- `login`: log in to the server
- `upload`: upload a file to the server (will default to the user's home
  directory if no destination path is specified)
- `info`: view some general information about your server
- `restart`: restart a specific service. Shortcut for logging in and running
  `sudo systemctl restart ...`
- `reboot`: reboot the server
- `ping`: ping the server
- `autorenew`: setup letsencrypt certificates to automatically be renewed
- `addkey`: add an authorized ssh key to the server for your account
- `adduser`: add an admin user account to the server
- `tomcatlog`: view the contents of the tomcat log file, `/opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out`
- `followlog`: watch the contents of the tomcat log file in real-time (`tail -f`)

### Site and Database Management Commands

The `site`, `db`, and `devserver` subcommands themselves contain subcommands
which can be seen by running the command by itself.

`site`

- `list`: view the sites that are currently setup on the server
- `create`: create a new site
- `build`: trigger a build and deployment of an existing site
- `remove`: remove a site. Will remove the nginx config for the site, as well as
  any previously deployed `war`s
- `enablessl`: enable https for a site
- `info`: show general information for a site
- `deploy`: deploy a `war` file for an individual site

`db`

- `login`: login to your mysql database
- `list`: list the databases that exist on your server
- `create`: create a new database and a user with privileges on only that
  database
- `backup`: create a backup of a database
- `run`: run a sql script for a specific database
- `remove`: remove a database and user

```

OR

```bash
./server site deploy
```

and you will be prompted for the site to deploy to, as well as the filepath for
the `war` file.

## Sharing your server with teammates

**For person who setup the server**

1. Make sure you want to give admin access to your teammate.

    The `./server adduser` command will create another user account on the
    server **with admin privileges**.

1. Get your teamate's public ssh key and save it locally

1. Run the appropriate `./server` command

    ```bash
    ./server adduser sally ~/sallys_ssh_key.pub
    ```

1. Choose (or have your teamate choose) a password for the new user

1. (Optionally) log into your mysql server and create a database administrator
   account for the new user.

    ```
    ./server db login
    # from mysql
    CREATE USER sally@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'astrongpassword';
    GRANT ALL ON *.* TO sally@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```

**For the teamate being added**

1. Clone this repo

    ```bash
    git clone <url> ~/shared-server
    ```

1. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

    ```
    ip=<the-servers-ip-address>
    user=<the-user-you-just-created>
    ```

    Replace the values in `<>`s with their appropriate values. Note there needs
    to be **no spaces** around the `=` sign.

    Example `.env`

    ```
    ip=123.123.123.123
    user=sally
    ```

## Uploads

Nginx is set up to intercept any requests to `/uploads` and try to serve them
out of the uploads directory for your site, which is located at

```
/var/www/example.com/uploads
```

You can setup your application to interact with this directory, and use the
`upload` subcommand to manually put files here.

## Development Webserver

There is a subcommand of server, `devserver` that can be used to start up nginx
locally. This will simulate the nginx setup running in production, but it is up
to you to start the tomcat server locally on port 8080.

```bash
./server devserver my-project.dev
```

see the built in help

```bash
./server devserver
```

for more details.

## Bash Completion

There is a script (`scripts/bash_completion.sh`) that provides tab completion
for the `./server` command. You can either source this file manually, or run

```
scripts/install-bash-completion.sh
```
