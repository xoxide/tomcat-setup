# config for sensitive information file
#
# This file needs to define two variables,
# - source: the file to be copied (e.g. file with database credentials in it)
# - destination: where to copy it
# that are referenced in the post-receive hook for this site
#
# The source file is relative to this site's directory, and the destination
# filepath is relative to your project.
#
# For example, in a spring boot application, you might have an
# application.properties file with database credentials in it that is not in
# version control, but needs to be part of the project. If your site is named
# example.com, you would create the application.properties file with the live
# database credentials in /srv/example.com/application.properties.
#
# For the scenario described above, uncomment the two lines below
# source=application.properties
# destination=src/main/resources/application.properties

# or uncomment the two lines below to define your own file
# source=
# destination=
