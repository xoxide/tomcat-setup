# Deployment

This document is meant to supplement the [documentation included with the
deployment tool](https://github.com/gocodeup/tomcat-setup), and to be a mostly
complete guide to codeup students on deploying their spring boot applications.

See also the [FAQs](faq.md)

## Overview

1. Change the application to be buildable as a `war`.
1. Setup + Provision the server
1. Setup a database and site and configure git deployment

## Build A War From your application

This tool is setup to host any web application that is packaged as a `war`.
Previously we have just been running the `main` method in our application, but
Spring boot will also allow us to package our application as a `war`.

1. Make sure your app runs locally!

    Before making any changes or deploying your application, make sure
    everything is working the way you expect it to locally.

    From the root of your project, run the following command:

    ```
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    This will start your application up from the command line, and more closely
    mimicks the environment your application will be running in in production.

1. Tell our application to be bundled as a war

    We will need to make some changes to our application to allow it to be
    packaged as a `war`. These will be one-time operations, and we will still be
    able to run our application through the `main` method, like before.

    - Change the `<packaging>` in the `pom.xml` from `jar` to `war`

    Edit your class with the `main` method

    ```java
    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
    import org.springframework.boot.web.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class BlogApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(BlogApplication.class, args);
        }

        protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
            return application.sources(BlogApplication.class);
        }
    }
    ```

    - add the `extends` to the class definition
    - add the `configure` method

1. Make sure the `war` builds successfully

    Unless you've built out testing for your application, we will need to tell
    maven to skip running any tests before building the `war`.

    Add the following to your `pom.xml`

    ```
    <properties>
        ...
        <maven.test.skip>true</maven.test.skip>
    </properties>
    ```

    then, from the root of your project:

    ```
    ./mvnw package
    ```

    *Note: instead of modifying the `pom.xml`, you could also pass the
    `-DskipTests` flag to the maven package command.*

1. Setup the `.build_config` file

    Create a file in the root of your project named `.build_config`. This file
    is what tells the server how to build our project. This file should have the
    following contents:

    ```
    BUILD_COMMAND='./mvnw package'
    WAR_FILE=target/blog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
    ```

    *Your war file path could be different depending on how your project is
    setup, make sure the name of the war file matches up with what you defined
    in your `pom.xml`.*

    Make sure to add and commit the `.build_config` file!

## Domain Name + First Time Server Setup

1. Buy a domain name (we recommend namecheap), and point the DNS nameservers for
   that domain to digital ocean

    ```
    ns1.digitalocean.com
    ns2.digitalocean.com
    ns3.digitalocean.com
    ```

1. Sign up for digital ocean

1. Create a droplet on digitalocean.com

    Choose the $10/month, 1GB RAM droplet. *Note: choosing a smaller size
    droplet here can lead to out-of-memory crashes!*

    add your ssh key to the droplet

    ```
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
    ```

1. [Configure your domain's DNS settings with digital ocean.](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking)

    - Add an 'A' record that points to your droplet
    - optionally, add the 'www' subdomain

1. Clone the deployment tool

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:gocodeup/tomcat-setup.git ~/my-server
    ```

1. Provision the server with the setup script

    The script will prompt you for the server's IP address, so have it ready.

    ```
    cd ~/my-server
    ./server
    ```

## Site Setup

1. Create a database for your site

    ```
    ./server db create blog_db blog_user
    ```

    You will be prompted to choose a password for the new user, then we will
    require your *database admin* password to setup the user.

    The user and password you create here are what you should eventually put in
    your production `application.properties` file.

1. Setup your site

    This will prep tomcat and nginx to host your site. You will be prompted for
    your *server admin* password.

    ```
    ./server site create example.com
    ```

    If the DNS records are improperly configured, the script will warn you, you
    can go ahead and continue, you just won't be able to see your site unless
    you add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file like the following:

    ```
    111.111.111.111 example.com
    ```

    The output of this command will contain instructions for adding a git remote
    for deploment. Take note of this command, we will be using it later on.

1. Log in to the server to finalize deployment setup

    Login to the server.

    ```
    ./server login
    ```

    Create the production `application.properties` file.

    This file should be located in `/srv/example.com/application.properties` on
    your server, and should contain your production credentials.

    ```
    cd /srv
    cd example.com
    nano application.properties
    ```

    It's usually easiest to start by copying your local `application.properties`
    and pasting it into `nano`, then changing the relevant values.

    To save and exit nano:

    1. Ctrl-x
    1. Type `y`
    1. Press Enter

    Next, uncomment (i.e. delete the `# ` at the beginning of the line) the two
    lines in `/srv/example.com/config` that reference the
    `application.properties` file.

    ```
    nano config
    ```

    You can now log out of the server.

1. Deploy the site

    Add the git remote (from the site setup command) to your project, and push
    to your new remote.

    ```
    cd ~/IdeaProjects/my-project
    git remote add production ...
    git push production master
    ```
